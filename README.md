The Programming Team Catalog System is a Joomla component written for the UCF Programming Team during Senior Design which was preloaded with the past three yearsâ€™ worth of practice problem data. It allows programming team members and coaches to better practice by using it's capability to create new problem sets for particular students in order to strengthen weak points. In addition, it saves everyone involved time by marking past used problems so that reoccurring problems don't appear in subsequent practices. 

This is the Python script which scraped an internal UCF website to obtain raw problem data and then parse, process, and reformat 1348 individual problems including almost 10 Gb of respective metadata in the form of problem PDFs and sample input and output.
